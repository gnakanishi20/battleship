    // seperate print function
    // initialize a copy of the board, not entirely sure where to do this
    // with this copy set all values to 3 so it will print O
    // then have the print statement interate through all of the values printing as it goes,
    // for loop?
        // inside the for loop have the conditions
        // if 1 print X, 2 print " ", 3 print O
    
    
    // should I add a pause like in die? right now leaning towards no
    
    // make a seperate function that itterates through the identical board and gives every space in the array the value of 3
